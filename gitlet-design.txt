Classes and Data Structures

Init
    - The main part if init is the initialization of the .gitlet folder. When you make the folder, you should check to
      see if already exists, if so throw an exception error.
    - Once you create the folder, you will want to handle three things, staging, commits, and blobs.
        - For handling staging, I'm thinking to create two hash maps. One for adding, and one for removing
        This will be associated with the add as when you add
    - I also want to create a general hashmap that I can refer to that can refer IDs to the files they refer to
